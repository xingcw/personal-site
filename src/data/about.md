# Personal Story

At 20, the anime `Naruto: Shippuden` concluded. I have never seen any better long manga series better than Naruto since then.

At 18, I finished the College Entrance Exam in Henan, China. Too many things happened after this milestone. I fell in love with my girlfriend after we knew each other for two years and had been deskmates for one year. I received as gifts and was allowed to own my first smart phone and PC.

At 14, I broke one of my front tooth when I played with one of my friends. Half of my original tooth is in a box at my home in China, where is thousands of kilometers far from me now.

At 10, I transferred to another bigger school in my county and I lived no longer with families anymore. Every two weeks, we have two days holidays. I still remember the countless mornings I waited in the big square of the school for my bus home.

At 6 - 10, I studied at the preliminary school in my countryside. I spent my happy childhood together with other friends there. Although we didn't have video games, we could come up with thousands of ideas to play around and enjoy the beautiful views of our countryside.

I was born in a underdeveloped countryside.
