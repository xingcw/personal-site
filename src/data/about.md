# Personal Story

- At 20, the anime `Naruto: Shippuden` concluded. Naruto accompanied me go through my whole teenagerhood.

- At 18, I finished the College Entrance Exam in Henan, China. Too many things happened after this milestone. 
I fell in love with my girlfriend after we knew each other for two years and had been deskmates for one year. 

- At 14, I broke one of my front tooth when I played with one of my friends. Half of my original tooth is in a box at my home in China,
where is thousands of kilometers far from me now.

- I was born in a small countryside.
