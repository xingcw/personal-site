# Intro

I'm currently a Research Assistant at [Robotics and Perception Group(RPG)](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/) dierected
by [Prof. Davide Scaramuzza](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/people_scaramuzza.html) at the University of Zurich. 
I was a master student in Robotics, Systems and Control at [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/de.html), and I
finished my master thesis at [RPG](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/), focusing on the vision-based reinforcement learning 
for autonomous drone racing. During my master's studies, I worked as a semester project student 
at [Robotic Systems Lab(RSL)](https://rsl.ethz.ch/)
directed by [Prof. Dr. Marco Hutter](https://rsl.ethz.ch/the-lab/people/person-detail.MTIxOTEx.TGlzdC8yNDQxLC0xNDI1MTk1NzM1.html).
I also worked at [Autonomous Systems Lab(ASL)](https://asl.ethz.ch/) directed by 
[Prof. Dr. Roland Siegwart](https://asl.ethz.ch/the-lab/people/person-detail.Mjk5ODE=.TGlzdC8yMDI4LDEyMDExMzk5Mjg=.html) for 
the [Perception Learning for Robotics](https://asl.ethz.ch/education/lectures/perception_and_learning_for_robotics.html) course project.
I got my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).

My current research interests are vision-based reinforcement learning for agile robotics control and 
learning-based robotics control.

<!-- # Personal Story

- At 20, the anime `Naruto: Shippuden` concluded. Naruto accompanied me go through my whole teenagerhood.

- At 18, I finished the College Entrance Exam in Henan, China. Too many things happened after this milestone. 
I fell in love with my girlfriend after we knew each other for two years and had been deskmates for one year. 

- At 14, I broke one of my front tooth when I played with one of my friends. Half of my original tooth is in a box at my home in China,
where is thousands of kilometers far from me now.

- I was born in a small countryside.  -->
