Naruto accompanied me go through my whole teenagerhood.\r\n\r\n- At 18, I finished the College Entrance Exam in Henan, China. Too many things happened after this milestone. \r\nI fell in love with my girlfriend after we knew each other for two years and had been deskmates for one year. \r\n\r\n- At 14, I broke one of my front tooth when I played with one of my friends. Half of my original tooth is in a box at my home in China,\r\nwhere is thousands of kilometers far from me now.\r\n\r\n- I was born in a small countryside.  --\x3e\r\n\r\n# I like\r\n\r\n- Running\r\n- Skiing\r\n- Table Tennis\r\n- Tennis\r\n- [Movies](https://www.notion.so/ad6a03796b3642f9aa557d92846d5e86?v=704c62ed21e24c8881f9fb32cf400d70)\r\n\r\n# Acknowledgement\r\n\r\nI inherited this page from the original author, [Michael D'Angelo](https://mldangelo.com/), whose website works like a charm.
