In our previous work, a combined sampling and optimization based method is proposed to solve the problem.We expect to further improve the efficiency of the sampling-based planner by substituting the heuristic base pose selectorwith a learning-based method. We formulate a Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem for the base pose selector and optimize the reward functions to excel the potential of learning policy. In this project, we further optimize the RL policyby experimenting with different training methods. We formulate evaluation metrics for the RL testing and benchmark the performance of our learned policybased on it. Besides, we benchmark the performance of brute force search method for comparison. In the end, we finish the preparation stepsto integrate our learned policy into the global planner."},{title:"Descriptellation: Deep Learned Constellation Descriptors for SLAM",subtitle:"Perception Learning for Robotics - Course Project",video_link:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_28-maRwmo&list=PL05BR7PIAwqAx0VgwNVHPepqPwg433qfx&index=1",title_link:"https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00567",image:"/images/projects/descriptellation.jpg",date:"Feb. 2021 - Jun. 2021",desc:"Current global localization descriptors in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) often failunder vast viewpoint or appearance changes. Adding topological information of semantic objects into the descriptorsameliorates the problem. However, hand-crafted topological descriptors extract limited informationand they are not robust to environmental noise, drastic perspective changes, or object occlusion or misdetections.To solve this problem, we formulate a learning-based approach by constructing constellations from semantically meaningful objectsand use Deep Graph Convolution Networks to map the constellation representation to a descriptor. We demonstrate the effectivenessof our Deep Learned Constellation Descriptor (Descriptellation) on the Paris-Rue-Lille and IQmulus datasets. Although Descriptellationis trained on randomly generated simulation datasets, it shows good generalization abilities on real-world datasets.Descriptellation outperforms the PointNet and handcrafted constellation descriptors for global localization, and shows robustness against different types of noise."}],l=function(){return(0,s.jsx)(n.Z,{title:"Projects",description:"Learn about Chunwei Xing's projects.",children:(0,s.jsxs)("article",{className:"post",id:"projects",children:[(0,s.jsx)("header",{children:(0,s.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[(0,s.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:(0,s.jsx)(o.rU,{to:"/projects",children:"Projects"})}),(0,s.jsx)("p",{children:"A selection of course and research projects in my Master Program."})]})}),a.map((function(e){return(0,s.jsx)(r,{data:e},e.title)}))]})})}}}]);
